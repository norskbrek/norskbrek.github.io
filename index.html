  <p class="sellYourself">I am a logical, creative thinker seeking to exit the service industry and enter the tech industry. I have strong experience with accurate cash handling and positive business/client relations. I am adept at coffee, tea, and bagel preparation and acquisition, and if need be, to get my foot in the door, can valiantly perform the stereotypical responsibilities of an intern and purchase any and all of these items for my employer.</p>
