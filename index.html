			<p>Following the well-worn local Lutheran track, I endured four years at this rural, sports-obsessed institution. When nerves got the best of me on the baseball field, I found my niche (and fed my ego) by taking up theater. I starred in several productions (Fiddler on the Roof, Enter Laughing, Hello Dolly!), and also finished as Valedictorian of my class. Bonus points for accidentally ingesting parasite-filled sewage run-off during a mission trip to Costa Rica.</p>

			<h3>St. John's Lutheran School</h3>

			<h4>1998 - 2001<h4>
		<div>
			<p>Horrified by the prospect of our local public middle school’s locker rooms, I employed my “conscientious objector” methods of stubborn resistance and forced my parents to enroll me in a smaller school. This choice began my 11 year journey through parochial Lutheran education. At this small, reactionary school, I hand-wrote a (still-unfinished) 250pp. fantasy novel, starred at half-back on our flag football team, and learned the fine subtleties of playing the classroom Devil’s Advocate.</p>
